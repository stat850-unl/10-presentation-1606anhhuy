Here is the plot that used in assignment 8: Graphics. I like the distribution and colorful of it:

```{r penguins, results='hide', echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
if (!"palmerpenguins" %in% installed.packages()) {
  remotes::install_github("allisonhorst/palmerpenguins")
}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
head(penguins)
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_length_mm, color = species)) +
