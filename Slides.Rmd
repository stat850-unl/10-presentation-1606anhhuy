## Introduction

- My name is Huy ngo, and I am a first year graduate student. I was born in Vietnam but moved to the US in 2013, on a Thanksgiving Day. I lived in Texas most of the time, and just moved to Nebraska to study statistics. I expecting to graduate in 2025.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
