## Introduction 

- My name is Huy ngo, and I am a first year graduate student. I was born in Vietnam but moved to the US in 2013, on a Thanksgiving Day. I lived in Texas most of the time and barely see snow fall (probably in 2014), but after that, no more. Yesterday was the first time I see so much snow, and somebody told me this is just the beginning.
- I am supposed to graduate in 2025, but I want to push the time a little bit, to graduate sooner. To do that, I need to think about the topic for research. Or I don't have to think about it too soon and focusing on the current classes (try to pass them without receiving a C, I guess)

## Plots

Here is the plot that used in assignment 8: Graphics. I like the distribution and how colorfull it is:

```{r penguins, results='hide', echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
if (!"palmerpenguins" %in% installed.packages()) {
  remotes::install_github("allisonhorst/palmerpenguins")
}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
head(penguins)
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_length_mm, color = species)) + 
  geom_point()
```
