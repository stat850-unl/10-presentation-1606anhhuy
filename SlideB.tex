- My name is Huy ngo, and I am a first year graduate student. I was born in Vietnam but moved to the US in 2013, on a Thanksgiving Day. I lived in Texas most of the time and barely see snow fall (probably in 2014), but after that, no more. Yesterday was the first time I see so much snow, and somebody told me this is just the beginning.
- I am supposed to graduate in 2025, but I want to push the time a little bit, to graduate sooner. To do that, I need to think about the topic for research. Or I don't have to think about it too soon and focusing on the current classes (try to pass them without receiving a C, I guess)
